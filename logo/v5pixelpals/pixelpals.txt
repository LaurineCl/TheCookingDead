V5 Pixelpals
---------------
Instructions:


++ Pixelpals ++

This is a dingbat font that contains a 
variety of "characters" with different facial 
expressions, along with a few additional -non 
character- pictorials. _All_ uppercase, 
lowercase, numerals, shift-numerals, and 
_some_ punctuation keys on a standard US 
keyboard are accounted for. 

Set on screen at 20pt (or multiple of), with 
antialias off.


---------------
Usage:  This is a free font--you may use 
this and other V5 fonts at will.  It may not 
be sold, altered, or improperly credited,
however.  All I ask is that you kindly inform 
me if you find this font useful, and where
you've used it.

Enjoy,
